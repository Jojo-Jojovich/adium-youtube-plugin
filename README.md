YouTube Adium Plugin
====================

Originally by [Vincenzo Mantova (xworld21)](http://adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=6655#c34835), modified to make it working again on Intel Macs and compile with the latest version of XCode.

## (Original) Description
This plugin shows a row of thumbnails after every message containing a youtube link. Clicking on a thumbnail will show the video right inside the chat window. 

Caveats
- The video cannot be resized.
- There is no localization support (i.e. the video controls will always appear in English and the "close" link will always be "close").
- The video will move together with the text! You'll have to stay quiet till the end.
- The plugin only works with links beginning with "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=".
- It can be used only with version 4 message styles (those provided with Adium are ok).

All rights and credit go to the original author, Vincenzo Mantova, I simply made it working again.

## It doesn't works!
Feel free to submit an issue, I'll do my best to find a fix, but please keep in mind this is the first time I have compiled an Xcode project in my life!
